# Coroutines and MVVM 

# Master is for releases. For current version check "dev" branch

Basic example of coroutines using AAC

Roadmap:
1. Idea for application (maybe use external api like spotify for music stats (research on terms of use))
2. Exo player with ability to play music/sounds from internal storage
3. Onboarding screen just for fun
4. Add links to real music sites
5. Try last features like assistant, slices
